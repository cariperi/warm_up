# Organizing with Hashes! Create a Hash that stores all the items on your desk.
# Anything that has more than 1 thing inside should be represented by its own key/value pair.
# Single items ("pen") can be described in its value ("pen" => "black").

# Ex: desk = { "pencil": "#2", :mousepad => ["mouse", "wrist rest"], :computer => ["chip", "fan"], â€¦}

# Then, write a method that lists the items out in order. If an item has more than 1 thing inside of it, make it display underneath and tabbed over:

# Ex:
# Pencil

# Mousepad:
# Wrist rest
# Mouse

# Computer:
# Chip
# Fan

# Extension ideas:

# - Make your method list the items out in alphabetical order, no matter their original ordering.
# - Create methods that can add and remove items from your desk hash.
