# Hash Phonebook PART DEUX: Create a phonebook using a hash! Your book/hash should have least 5 different people's phone numbers.
# The phone numbers should be represented by **arrays**.Ex: phonebook = {"Adam": [555, 1234], "Briona": [123, 5555], "Charles": â€¦}

# Then, write a method that adds a new entry to your phonebook.
# Ex: add_number("Name", [419, 5540])Finally, write a method that takes a string name, and returns a formatted phone number.Ex: call("Adam") => "555-1234"

# Extension ideas:

# - If your `call` method can't find that name, it should return "Sorry, can't find that contact."
# - If your `call` method has multiple of the same name, it should return "Which one would you like to dial? " and then list all entries.
# - If you didn't use classes for this solution... why not? ;)
